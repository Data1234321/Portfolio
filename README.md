Welcome to my Portfolio!

As an accomplished professional completing a **Level 4 Data Analytics Bootcamp** with a **Master's in Big Data**, I excel
in **Python** and **R** programming, **data manipulation**, and **visualisation**. Seeking to leverage these skills in data and
analytics, my background as a client-facing senior label manager has equipped me with expertise in **project
management, data analysis, collaboration, strategic thinking, leadership, active listening**, and **communication.**
